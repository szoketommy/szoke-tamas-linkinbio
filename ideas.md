### Design Movement: Neo-Brutalism / High-Contrast Modernism
**Core Principles:**
- **Bold Authority:** Reflects the "Investoprenor" persona—confident, direct, and impactful.
- **Raw & Real:** Strips away unnecessary fluff to focus on the value and the links.
- **High Contrast:** Uses stark differences in size and color to guide attention immediately.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Monochrome with a Punch:** Dominant black and white for high contrast, with a sharp "Electric Lime" or "Signal Orange" accent. This conveys energy, urgency, and modern financial tech vibes.
- **Emotional Intent:** Trust, clarity, and action-oriented.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Asymmetric Stack:** Instead of a centered list, links are large, blocky cards that might offset slightly or span different widths.
- **Split Screen Desktop:** On larger screens, a fixed bio/portrait on the left, scrollable massive link blocks on the right.

**Signature Elements:**
- **Thick Borders:** Heavy black borders on cards and buttons (2px-4px).
- **Oversized Typography:** Headings that bleed to the edge or take up significant vertical space.
- **Brutalist Shadows:** Hard, non-blurred drop shadows at a 45-degree angle.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **Tactile Feedback:** Buttons depress visibly (translate Y) on click.
- **Hover States:** Invert colors completely on hover (Black bg/White text -> White bg/Black text).

**Animation:**
- **Staggered Entrance:** Link blocks slam in from the bottom with a heavy spring physics feel.
- **Marquee Text:** A scrolling ticker for "Investoprenor • Speaker • Mentor" to add dynamic movement.

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** 'Space Grotesk' or 'Syne' – wide, geometric, slightly quirky sans-serifs.
- **Body:** 'DM Sans' or 'Archivo' – clean, legible, but with character.

### Design Movement: Glassmorphism / Ethereal Tech
**Core Principles:**
- **Transparency & Depth:** Represents the clarity and insight of an investor.
- **Fluidity:** Symbolizes the flow of capital and ideas.
- **Premium Polish:** A high-end look that suggests wealth and sophistication.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Deep Space Gradients:** Dark blues, purples, and teals in the background, representing the depth of the market.
- **Frosted Glass:** White/light gray with high blur and low opacity for cards.
- **Emotional Intent:** Sophistication, future-forward, and calm confidence.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Floating Cards:** Links appear as floating glass panes over a moving, abstract background.
- **Central Axis with Breathing Room:** A more traditional centered alignment but with massive vertical spacing to let the background shine.

**Signature Elements:**
- **Backdrop Blur:** Heavy usage of `backdrop-filter: blur()` on all UI elements.
- **Subtle Borders:** 1px semi-transparent white borders to define edges without heaviness.
- **Glow Effects:** Soft, colored glows behind the profile picture or key call-to-action buttons.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **Soft Lifts:** Cards gently float up and glow brighter on hover.
- **Parallax:** Background moves slightly slower than the foreground content on scroll.

**Animation:**
- **Slow Fade-ins:** Elements drift in slowly from opacity 0.
- **Ambient Motion:** The background gradient or shapes slowly morph and rotate continuously.

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** 'Outfit' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' – modern, geometric, friendly but tech-focused.
- **Body:** 'Inter' (light weights) – invisible, purely functional.

### Design Movement: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Modernized)
**Core Principles:**
- **Grid Precision:** Order, logic, and reliability—key traits for an investor.
- **Content First:** The message is the hero; design is the frame.
- **Objective Clarity:** No distractions, just pure communication.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Primary Palette:** Deep Navy Blue (Trust), Crisp White (Clarity), and a muted Gold or Bronze (Wealth/Success).
- **Emotional Intent:** Professionalism, stability, and established success.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Modular Grid:** A strict grid system where links might be 2-up or 1-up depending on importance, but always perfectly aligned.
- **Typographic Hierarchy:** Size and weight denote importance, not decoration.

**Signature Elements:**
- **Rule Lines:** Thin horizontal lines separating sections or links.
- **Asymmetric Balance:** Profile info might be top-left, while links cascade down the right, balanced by negative space.
- **Iconography:** Minimalist, stroke-based icons.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **Micro-interactions:** Subtle color shifts or underline expansions on hover.
- **Snap:** Interactions feel instant and precise, no "mushy" springs.

**Animation:**
- **Reveal:** Content is revealed by sliding out from behind "masks" (clipping paths).
- **Sequential Load:** Items load in a strict top-to-bottom sequence with precise timing.

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** 'Helvetica Now' (or 'Inter' Tight) – classic, neutral, authoritative.
- **Body:** 'Roboto Mono' for meta-data (dates, tags) to add a "data" feel, paired with a clean sans for main text.
